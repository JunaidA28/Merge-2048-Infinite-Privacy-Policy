## Information Collection and Use

### Data We Collect

**We do not collect any personally identifiable information from users of our App.**

The App stores game data (such as your high score and game state) locally on your device using local storage. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to our servers.

### Data Collected by Third Parties

Our App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. Google AdMob may collect certain information to serve personalized ads. This may include:

- Device identifiers (Advertising ID)
- IP address
- Device and browser information

- Location data (approximate)

If you believe that a child under 13 has provided personal information through our App, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

## Data Storage and Security

All game data (high scores, settings, game state) is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data, and it is not transmitted to any external servers.
